# Pacman Game in Java 🎮

Welcome to my first-ever Java project—a classic Pacman game! 🕹️ This project was created as part of my journey to learn Java programming, and I'm proud to share it with you all. While it's a humble beginning, it represents an exciting step into the world of software development. 

## Features ✨
- **Classic Pacman Gameplay:** Navigate the maze, collect points, and avoid ghosts.
- **Simple Graphics:** Basic, beginner-friendly visuals to focus on core mechanics.
- **Keyboard Controls:** Use arrow keys to guide Pacman through the maze.

## Project Structure 📂
- **`src/`**: Contains all the Java source code files.
- **`README.md`**: This file—providing details about the project.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **Java:** The primary programming language for this project.
- **Swing/AWT:** For creating the user interface and game visuals.

## Getting Started 🚀

Follow these steps to run the game on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aimekelvin/pacman_java.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd pacman_java
   ```

3. **Compile the Code:**
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```

4. **Run the Game:**
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Main
